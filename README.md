Genetic Algorithm Research
========================================

This project contains research related to the use of variable mutation rates for 
genetic algorithms with a focus on the improvement of variable mutation rates in
comparison to fixed mutation rates for computationally expensive problems.


Introduction
----------------------------------------

Our initial course project was to implement a solution to the 
[8 Queens Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_queens) our solution to the 
problem using a variable mutation rate rather than a fixed mutation rate
performed extremely well. As a result, the purpose of this research is to further 
investigate the potential applications for using our method of a variable mutation 
rate rather than a constant fixed mutation rate by evaluating the effectiveness of 
a variable mutation rate for larger size of the N Queens Puzzle.

Our implementation uses a standard Genetic Algrorithm **(GA)** with roulette 
wheel selection method as well as cross-over, mutation, and cloning for the 
operations on the chromosomes.


Methodology, Analysis, and Conclusions
---------------------------------------

For more information on our methodology, the algorithms used, as well as our 
analysis and conlcusions please see our paper located in the [paper]([paper/) 
directory.
